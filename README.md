# Supply-Chain-Authenticity-Tracker-# Supply Chain Authenticity Tracker

## Project Description

The Supply Chain Authenticity Tracker is a blockchain-based solution that provides transparent and immutable tracking of products throughout their entire supply chain journey. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, this system enables manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to verify product authenticity and trace the complete history of any item from creation to final destination.

The project leverages blockchain's inherent properties of transparency, immutability, and decentralization to combat counterfeiting, ensure product quality, and build consumer trust in the supply chain ecosystem.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a world where every product has a verifiable digital identity that cannot be forged or manipulated. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Counterfeiting**: Make it impossible for fake products to enter legitimate supply chains
- **Enhance Consumer Trust**: Provide consumers with complete transparency about product origins and journey
- **Improve Supply Chain Efficiency**: Enable quick identification and resolution of quality issues
- **Support Ethical Sourcing**: Verify that products meet ethical and sustainability standards
- **Enable Regulatory Compliance**: Provide auditable trails for regulatory requirements

## Key Features

### üîê **Immutable Product Creation**
- Authorized manufacturers can create unique digital identities for physical products
- Each product gets a unique blockchain ID with timestamp and manufacturer information
- Only verified manufacturers can create authentic products

### üì¶ **Complete Journey Tracking**
- Track products through every step of the supply chain
- Record location changes, ownership transfers, and handling notes
- Maintain complete history of all parties involved in the product journey

### ‚úÖ **Real-time Authenticity Verification**
- Consumers can verify product authenticity using the product ID
- Get complete supply chain history including all previous owners
- View detailed journey steps from creation to current location

### üë• **Multi-party Access Control**
- Admin controls for managing authorized manufacturers
- Role-based permissions ensuring only legitimate parties can modify records
- Ability to mark products as counterfeit if fraud is detected

### üîç **Transparent Audit Trail**
- All transactions are recorded on the blockchain with timestamps
- Complete ownership history for regulatory compliance
- Immutable records that cannot be altered or deleted

## Future Scope

### üì± **Mobile Application Integration**
- QR code scanning for instant product verification
- Consumer-friendly mobile app for easy authenticity checks
- Push notifications for product recalls or safety alerts

### üåê **IoT Sensor Integration**
- Temperature, humidity, and GPS tracking for sensitive products
- Automated condition monitoring throughout transportation
- Smart contract triggers based on environmental conditions

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analytics**

- Anomaly detection for identifying potential counterfeiting attempts
- Machine learning for risk assessment and quality predictions

### üîó **Cross-Chain Interoperability**
- Integration with multiple blockchain networks
- Support for various token standards and payment methods
- Cross-platform compatibility for global supply chains

### üìä **Advanced Reporting Dashboard**
- Real-time analytics and reporting for businesses
- Supply chain performance metrics and KPIs
- Compliance reporting and audit trail generation

### üåç **Global Standards Integration**
- Integration with international supply chain standards (GS1, ISO)
- Support for multiple languages and regional regulations
- Compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations

### ‚ôªÔ∏è **Sustainability Tracking**
- Carbon footprint calculation for each product
- Sustainability scoring and environmental impact tracking
- Integration with carbon credit marketplaces

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Hardhat or Truffle Suite
- MetaMask or other Web3 wallet
- Solidity ^0.8.19

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Supply-Chain-Authenticity-Tracker

# Install dependencies
npm install

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Usage
1. Deploy the smart contract to your preferred Ethereum network
2. Add authorized manufacturers using the admin account
3. Manufacturers can create products using `createProduct()`
4. Transfer products through the supply chain using `transferProduct()`
5. Anyone can verify product authenticity using `verifyProduct()`
